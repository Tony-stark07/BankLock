Description: Our app lets users set and edit category-based budgets, track spending through a dashboard with remaining balance, financial health score, and category breakdowns, and record transactions with real-time validation. It blocks overspending (with essential overrides), stores transaction history, supports secure login, and plans to add smart budget alerts.
